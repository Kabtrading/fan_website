                        Chris Cornell (1964-2017) was a modern innovator who transcends genre. He was the chief architect of the 90s-grunge movement
                        and remains one of the best voices of all time. Achieving multi-platinum success with three legendary
                        bands – selling over 30 million records worldwide – he forged his own unique identity over three
                        decades as a Grammy® Award-winning, Golden Globe nominated singer, songwriter, guitarist, composer
                        and lyricist.

                        Few rock guitarists in the 1990s were as groundbreaking as Rage Against the Machine's Tom Morello, who incorporated a myriad
                        of different styles into his own playing. Born in New York City on May 30, 1964, Morello was raised
                        by his mother (who, decades later, would help create the anti-censorship organization Parents for
                        Rock &amp; Rap) in Libertyville, Illinois. As a teenager, Morello became infatuated with both rock
                        music and politics, as he was almost entirely self-taught on guitar (in fact, he learned the most
                        about the instrument while practicing up to eight hours a day during a stint at Harvard University,
                        where Morello majored in political science).

                        and Prophets of Rage (2016–present). Wilk started his career as a drummer for Greta in 1990, and
                        helped co-found Rage with Tom Morello and Zack de la Rocha in August 1991. Following that band's
                        breakup in October 2000 Wilk, Morello, Rage Against the Machine bassist Tim Commerford, and Soundgarden
                        front man Chris Cornell formed the supergroup Audioslave, which broke up in 2007. As of 2016, he
                        is playing in the band Prophets of Rage, with Commerford, Morello, Chuck D, B-Real and DJ Lord.
